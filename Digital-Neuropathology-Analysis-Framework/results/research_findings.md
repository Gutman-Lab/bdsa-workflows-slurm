# Neuropathology Research Findings


    RESEARCH FINDINGS - NEUROPATHOLOGY ANALYSIS

    In this study, we analyzed 100 neuropathology samples. 
    We found a correlation of 0.040 between amyloid burden (SPPP) and cognitive function (MMSE). Age showed a correlation of -0.133 with pathology severity. 
    These findings suggest significant relationships between pathological markers 
    and clinical outcomes, providing insights for early diagnosis and intervention.
