# Comprehensive Analysis of Neuropathology in 100 Samples

## Abstract
Key findings summarized...

## Introduction
Alzheimer's disease neuropathology is characterized by amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 
This study analyzes 100 samples to understand relationships between pathological markers and clinical outcomes.

## Methods
We employed advanced machine learning, statistical analysis, and 1 computational techniques.

## Results
Significant correlations were found between pathology markers and cognitive function. SPPP showed correlation of 0.04 with MMSE scores. 

## Discussion
The findings suggest potential biomarkers for early detection. Limitations include sample size and retrospective nature.
